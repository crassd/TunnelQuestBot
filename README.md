# Tired of staring at EC Tunnel spam to get that item you're lusting after?  Give yourself a break by setting up a Watch and let tunnelQuestBot do the work for you.

# "TunnelQuestBot takes the chore out of trading items." - James Jamail (tunnelQuestBot creator)
# 
# - GETTING STARTED -
# 1\) Join the TunnelQuest Discord Server <a href='https://discord.gg/HD8dpW'>here</a>
# 2\) Add A Watch by sending a direct message or channel message stating "!add watch: <item name>, <minimum price>, <server color>".  That's it! Whenever your watched item is auctioned for sale on the specefied server at or under your minimum price, you will receive a direct message from TunnelQuestBot detailing the seller, item, price and server.  Watches expire after 7 days.  Adding a watch for an already watched item overwrites it and renews the expiration date.
# 3\) To see your currently watched items, type "!show watch" or "!show watches".
# 4\) To see a specefic watch, type "!show watch: <item name>".
# 5\) To end a watch, type "!end watch: <item name>"
